## Overview:
The purpose of this challenge was to utilize the NYC data to find out trends that would help convince investors that a bike-sharing business is a solid business proposal for Des Moines. For this analysis, we needed to find trends based on time, gender, start and end time. This would help us find possible similar trends to Des Moines and things to look out for when staring this business.
## Results of Each Worsheet:
### Gender breakdown:

There are more males than females utilizing the bike-sharing program. In the chart above, it's clear that there are more than 50% of customers that are male, which is a clear indication that more men tend to utilize the bike-sharing service.
# Peak Hours:

If we are looking at times to have maintenance done on bikes or lower the employee count, we can look at early in the morning or later in the evening. Our peak times are within 7am - 7pm, which is a clear indication that we would need to have more staff during these hours. We can conclude that we need more staff and bikes during daytime.
### Checkout Time For Users

Most of the customers that do take a bike-share tends to be around a little under an hour. This shows that most of our customers are probably taking short trips to their destination--possibly to and from work. It's clear that our customers are typically local commuters.
### Checkout Time by Gender:

It is a clear indiaction that men used more bikes than females. For men peak trip duration is 5 min and for female it is 6 min.



### Trips by Weekday per Hour

Majority of the times seems to be during when people are going to or coming from work. What's interesting to see is that there are still customers on Saturday, which show an opportunity to expand the number of trips here. It could be from people still working or new visiting we are unaware of.

### Trips by Gender(Weekday per Hour)

Most of the men travel around 8am and 6pm, most likely either going to work or coming home from work.

From the above image, we can see that most of people are subscriber and male gender. Every day of week is busy, but Some days like Monday, Tuesday and thursday are relatively more busy days.

## Summary:

At a high-level, we know most of the NYC bike-sharing are mainly men subscribers. They are utilizing the bike-sharing for commuting purposes, either going to or from work. Most of customer are using bike for less than an hour and are subscribers.

### Additional Visualizations:

- I would visualize the age groups of the gender to see if we would need to boost up marketing campaigns to a certain group or if there's a missing gap within the male population.
- There was a huge spike of "unknown" users, so I would want to visualize where these customers are traveling. This would help to see if we are looking at actual NY customers or visitors coming for the day.
- Visualize where we can possibilty attract more women in the mix to increase awareness about bike-sharing. We would need to see where there are less travel trips by gender.
